I've choosen Google Sheets because it's free and has a mobile app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/apple-store/id842849113?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.docs.editors.sheets) devices (so you can enter data when you're out and about)


2. Monthly or quartery visualizations of emissions
- the number of flights
- the estimated amount of emissions
- Car-travel equivalent
